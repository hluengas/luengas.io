# **Projects**
**Ray Traced Photorealistic Video Renderer**
* Developed a multithreaded and object-oriented C++ image render that utilizes a spatial data-structure
* The program parses and renders a subset of the POV-Ray scene description standard
* Features include a Cook-Torrance BDRF, reflection, refraction, shadowing, and Fresnel effects
* Planes, triangles, spheres, boxes, and multiple lights are all supported and can use matrix transformations
* The renderer applies rudimentary kinematics to produce successive frames for an output video 

**Tie-Dye Pixel Art Renderer**
* Wrote a renderer in Python with the goal of investigating various methods of process acceleration
* Implemented JIT compilation using NumPy and Numba to show the drawbacks of the Python interpreter
* Implemented sequential and parallel running modes to investigate the performance of CPU parallelism
* Implemented a GPU compute mode with OpenCL to show how the process scales to hundreds of workers
* Implemented an R*Tree spatial data structure to display the speedup possible with an optimized algorithm

**3D Marble Run Platformer Game**
* Collaborated with a group to create a game from scratch in C++ and OpenGL
* Features include physics simulation, a spatial data structure, PBR shaders, shadow-mapping, environmentmapping, view frustum culling, positional audio, enemy AI, and an adjustable third person camera

**Music Visualizer**
* Coded an interactive audio visualization program in C++ and OpenGL using audio captured from the system
* Programmed a procedural landscape with variable height based on Fast Fourier transform of the audio

**AI Video Summarization Tool**
* Worked with a group to create a utility to pare down security camera footage using AI image recognition
* Developed in Python using YOLOv3 for object detection and OpenCV for image manipulation

**Networked Chat App and Packet Analyzer**
* Wrote client and server programs in C that use TCP to convey custom message packets between users
* Created a utility in C  that uses NPCAP to inspect packets, functioning like a basic version of Wireshark

**Animation Blending in OpenGL**
* Created an animation in C++ and OpenGL where a model skeleton goes through a series of dances with animation blending
* The models and dance animations were extracted from the Unreal Engine game Fortnite.

**Unix System Stats Logger**
* Wrote a CLI program in C to query unix system files for system and running process stats to be logged periodically to a file

**System Building & Networking**
* Built a virtualization server to use as a NAS, DNS resolver, Sophos UTM security gateway, and Docker host
